# Some reinforcement learning algorithms implementations
These algorithms are most assignments for the Deep Reinforcement Learning course at Universidade Federal do Ceara. (see the course page here: http://wikiufc.gelsol.org/courses/509/wiki/426)

## Content
This repo has the base algorithms and some games as well.
At the moment, it contains only 2048.

## Usage
You must install numpy for running the algorithms.
As for the games:
1. 2048: install pyautogui

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D
