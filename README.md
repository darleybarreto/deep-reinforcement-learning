# Some reinforcement learning algorithms implementations
These algorithms are most assignments for the Deep Reinforcement Learning course at Universidade Federal do Ceara. (see the course page here: http://wikiufc.gelsol.org/courses/509/wiki/426)

## Content
This repo has the base algorithms and some games as well.
At the moment, it some PLE games such as: Flappy Bird, Pong, Catcher, Water World, Snake, PuckWorld, PixelCopter.

## Usage
You must install numpy for running the algorithms.
As for the games:
1. PLE Games: install pygame, cv2, pytorch
